# CS-370


# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was given code for the maze environment and game experience object. The treasure maze environment code initialized the maze, defined the valid actions, reset the pirate to a set position, and drew the environment. It also handled rewards, actions, and state transitions for the pirate agent. The game experience object stored training episodes for the pirate agent. 

I created the code for the pirate intelligent agent to solve the maze. The agent implemented deep Q-learning to find the optimal path to the treasure. I trialed a variety of epsilon values for the agent and ultimately chose to decrease from a 10% to 1% exploration rate. The pirate agent spent most episodes exploiting known paths to the treasure over exploring new paths.
 
# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  # • What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists are involved with a wide variety of algorithm and data-based problems. Their work may be applied to any number of fields for an even greater number of purposes. In this course, I learned about the applications and ethical use of artificial intelligence. Computer scientists create applications of AI to solve the everyday problems in other fields. These applications could increase the efficiency of a company, deepen understanding of human intelligence, or solve long-standing problems which impede research. In essence, a computer scientist is a person who can adapt to and take on a variety of challenges.

  # • What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

In this course, I learned about the ethical responsibilities of a computer scientist, especially with regards to AI. AI models may train using personal information. If this information is not properly secured, it may jeopardize the safety or privacy of the end user. Additionally, companies operating in other countries may be subject to data protection laws, including GDPR. These laws dictate responsible data collection, usage, and storage guidelines. It is my role as a computer scientist to ensure I use only the minimum necessary personal information and that I store this information for the minimum necessary length of time.

Even if my code adheres to data collection and usage guidelines, it can be used inethically. AI is a tool which is only as ethical as its end user. If I create code which could potentially be used to harm my end users, it is imperative I mitigate these potential harms. 

  # • How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

In previous courses, my answer to this question involved the process I follow when writing code. However, I feel that this course taught me to consider problems from multiple perspectives. Previously, I considered functional code as the endpoint in a project. Throughout this course, I learned to analyze the ethical concerns and unintended consequences of code I write. I now understand my responsibility to my end users after code is complete. If my code is functional but may be used to harm end users, I must mitigate these issues. The most successful approach is one that includes a varied team of experts. I have learned to rely on ethics, sociology, security, and any other relevant experts when working on a problem. These team members understand the nuances of technology with respect to the problem it solves. If the code has the potential to harm end users, they will identify it during development. A key part of problem solving involves recognizing when your own experience is insufficient. Computer scientists must employ a team approach to tackle difficult problems.
